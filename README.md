> **The first generative AI-powered Bible study app on iOS (March 2023)**

I built ScriptureChat because I noticed that generative AI could be incredibly powerful for having meaningful conversations about faith and spiritual topics. As someone who values both technology and spirituality, I wanted to create a tool that could help people explore their faith journey through intelligent, scripture-based discussions.

The idea came from seeing how AI was being used for various applications, but I hadn't seen anything focused on spiritual growth and Bible study. I thought - what if we could create an AI companion that actually understands biblical context and can help people dive deeper into their faith?

## Why I Built This

I've always been interested in how technology can enhance our spiritual lives. When I started exploring generative AI, I realized it could be perfect for creating meaningful faith-based conversations. Most AI applications were focused on productivity or entertainment, but I saw an opportunity to use this technology to help people grow spiritually.

The challenge was building something that felt authentic and genuinely helpful, not just another AI chatbot. I wanted to create an experience that could adapt to different denominations, knowledge levels, and spiritual needs.

## What I Learned

Building ScriptureChat taught me a lot about:

- Integrating AI APIs into mobile apps
- Managing complex conversation state
- Building subscription-based revenue models
- Creating personalized user experiences
- Handling sensitive topics with appropriate AI prompts
